I am Hanwen Liu. A economics major graduate student. I dedicated to exploiting the economics knowledge to create real business value. At the capital valuation firm I performed financial analysis of an energy company in order to master its capital structure, thus better informing the valuation of various assets. Besides, I also visited the company and worked in-house there to serve professional consulting for it to reallocate its assets via replacement and acquisition. In another internship at New Times Securities I learned to track down stock info from Wind to facilitate the journal writing. Witnessing the dynamics of certain industries prompted me to think about the driving factors in economics and policies.
