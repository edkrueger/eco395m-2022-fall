Hello, my name is Annie Nguyen. I am from Houston, Texas. 
I started out in a completely different major in undergrad, 
but I found that I really enjoyed statistics, math, and economics.
I like working with data, so I hope I end up in a career where 
I can continue to grow my statistics and data skills.
