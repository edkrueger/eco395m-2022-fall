## Homework 2
You must have a _private_ repository with the name specified. You must also add me (edkrueger) and the TAs ([Click here for TA GitHub usernames](/ta-githubs.txt)) as collaborators.  

## Problem 0 - (0 points)
You'll clone a repo with several Python exercises.

a) Go to the repo: https://github.com/edkrueger/eco395m-codingbat   

b) Select "Use this template" and create a _private_ repository with the name "eco395m-codingbat".  

c) Select "Settings>Collaborators>" and add "edkrueger", "ericschulman" and "mynameisphatcao" as collaborators.    

## Problem 1 - (100 points)
You'll solve the coding bat exercises in `warmup-1.py`, `logic-1.py` and `logic-2.py`. You can check your answers by running each of the scripts.  

When grading this problem...  

20 points will be awarded for following the git instructions. We'll check the git history for three merges into the `main` branch. We won't count your commits, but you should have one for each exercise.  

80 points will be awarded in proportion to the number of exercises you successfully solve on the `main` branch. An exercise will be successfully solved if your solution passes all of the cases. A solution that does not pass all of the cases will not be considered successfully solved.  

_You are allowed to skip up to 4 exercises. There are 28 exercises total. So, submissions with at least 24 successfully solved exercises will receive all 80 points._  

a) Create a branch called `warmup-1` and check out the branch.  
b) For each function in `warmup-1.py`, modify the function so that all cases pass and commit your solution. There should be at least one commit per problem. _Do not modify the code under `if__name__=="__main__":`. Do not modify the code in `_check.py`. Do not hard code solutions to test cases in your functions. These will be considered academic dishonesty, and you will receive a 0 for this homework._  
_Do not import any modules or packages. The point of these exercises is to learn Python, not a library, package, or a module. You will receive a 0 for this homework, if you do._  
c) After solving all the problems in `warmup-1.py`, create a Pull Request to merge your code into the `main` branch, then merge the Pull Request.  
d) Repeat a, b and c with `logic-1`.    
e) Repeat a, b and c with `logic-2`.
