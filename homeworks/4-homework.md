## Homework 4
You must submit a URL to your _private_ GitHub repository to receive credit. You must also add me (edkrueger) and the TAs (ericschulman, mynameisphatcao) as collaborators.  

## Problem 0 - (0 points)
You'll use the repository you created in Homework 2 and used in Homework 3. If you did not attempt Homework 2 or Homework 3, see Homework 2's Problem 0 for instructions.

## Problem 1 - (100 points)
You'll solve the coding bat exercises in `warmup-2.py`, `list-2.py` and `string-2.py`. You can check your answers by running each of the scripts.  

When grading this problem...  

100 points will be awarded in proportion to the number of exercises you successfully solve. An exercise will be successfully solved if your solution passes all of the cases. A solution that does not pass all of the cases will not be considered successfully solved.  

_You are allowed to skip up to 3 exercises. There are 21 exercises total. So, submissions with at least 18 successfully solved exercises will receive all 100 points._  

a) Create a branch called `warmup-2` and check out the branch.  
b) For each function in `warmup-2.py`, modify the function so that all cases pass and commit your solution. _Do not modify the code under `if__name__=="__main__":`. Do not modify the code in `_check.py`. Do not hard code solutions to test cases in your functions. These will be considered academic dishonesty, and you will receive a 0 for this homework._  
_Do not import any modules, libraries or packages. The point of these exercises is to learn Python, not a library, package, or a module. You will receive a 0 for this homework, if you do._
c) After solving all the problems in `warmup-2.py`, create a Pull Request to merge your code into the `main` branch, then merge the Pull Request.  
d) Repeat a, b and c with `list-2`.  
e) Repeat a, b and c with `string-2`.
