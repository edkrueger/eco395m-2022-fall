Hello World, This is Ahmed Almezail a 2nd year MA in Economics 
student. I hold BS in Finance, and I had 3 years of experience in public 
policy and economic research. I already have a programming experience in R 
since I took a class in Data Mining and Statstical Inference. Heavily intrested 
in data science and statstical modelling and looking forward to get the 
most of this class. 

Peace out //
