# Course Description and Requirements

## Overview
This is a master's level course on Python, databases and big data. Our goal in this course is to learn the fundamental programming and data skills for working with data using a standard, modern tech stack. This is a foundational but fast-paced course; as such, we will move very quickly. We'll prefer practical applications over theoretical explorations.

Though we'll be learning many tools in this course, we'll focus on the big picture. By the end of this course, you should have a conceptual understanding of the data ecosystem as well as the practical skills required to programmatically access, load and manipulate data.

What this course is not:
* This is *_not_* a course in computer science. We won't cover topics like designing and evaluating algorithms or the inner working of databases.
* This is *_not_* a course on machine learning or AI. We won't cover machine learning algorithms. However, the material in this course is complementary: collecting, manipulating and maintaining data is a prerequisite to applied ML/AI.
* This is *_not_* a course on statistics. We won't cover the _statistical_ analysis of data. However, you'll find the material complementary: once data is in the correct form, most statistical tests are available in open-source packages and extremely simple to apply.
* This is *_not_* a course on application development. However, we will incidentally cover many of the same fundamentals and serve as a strong foundation.

## Reading and References
All reading and references for this course are optional. If you can complete the homework and contribute to your group projects without them, feel free to. There are many resources, freely available and otherwise.

That said, the quality of resources, especially the freely available ones, varies tremendously. There is a tremendous amount of bad advice, bad practices and just plain wrong information about coding and data on the internet.

Here is a non-exhaustive list of resources that I recommend and will suggest readings from in class:
* _Unix for the Beginning Mage_ by Joe Topjian (Freely available online.)
* _git - the simple guide_ by Roger Dudler (Freely available here: https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)
* _Think Python : How to Think Like a Computer Scientist_ By Downey, Allen B. (Get the 2nd edition. The 1st edition is written for Python 2, which is rather unlike Python 3)
* _Pandas 1. x Cookbook : Practical Recipes for Scientific Computing, Time Series Analysis, and Exploratory Data Analysis Using Python_ by Harrison, Matt and Petrou, Theodore (I'll be using the 2nd edition to suggest reading. The 1st edition uses an older version of Pandas, but should be mostly applicable.)
* _Practical SQL: A Beginner's Guide to Storytelling with Data_ by DeBarros, Anthony (I will use the 1st edition to suggest reading. However, a 2nd edition is coming out at the end of January. If you'd like to wait for its release, feel free to. We won't start SQL until after the midterm project.)

Other resources that I recommend:
* _Effective Pandas_ by Matt Harrison (An excellent read published after I selected textbooks for this course.)
* The Python Documentation: https://docs.python.org/3.7/
* The Pandas Documentation: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/
* The Postgres Documentation: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/
* The BigQuery Documentation: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery

## Software

We will use a lot of free, open-source software in this course, including but not limited to Python, Git and Postgres. I'll indicate when you need to install new software in class and sometimes make specific recommendations. If needed, the TAs will assist during TA office hours.

In addition, we'll use GitHub. The free plan will be sufficient for this course.

Finally, we will use Google Cloud Platform (GCP). GCP charges by use of services but offers a $300 credit to new accounts. This _should_ be sufficient for this course. Costs _may_, in some circumstances, exceed the credit amount. We'll provide guidance in keeping costs under control in class. _Please wait to redeem the credit until we instruct you to._

## Prerequisites

There are no formal prerequisites for this course. However, success in this course requires computer literacy, including the ability to install, use and troubleshoot software.

We will start from the beginning with Python. However, some slight exposure to programming is recommended to understand what you are signing up for. Programming is quite different from other skills you have acquired through your academic career.

## How to Succeed in This Course

### Durring Lectures
Lectures will be fast-paced, and you must pay attention in class. It can be tempting to replicate every step I take and write the same code I write _while in the lecture_. I don't recommend this as you'll likely fall behind and miss out on new material. So it may be wise to consider not opening your computer at all during class.

### Outside of Class
If you'd like to go back and try to replicate the work I do in class, you will have a recording of the lectures. Your homework and group projects will provide you with an opportunity to do it yourself.

After getting the big picture from lectures, the best way to learn to program is to do it. Attending lectures and completing the readings won't be sufficient. In fact, you should consider attempting the homeworks first and consulting the readings if you need assistance.

Please attend office hours.

### During Group Projects

A large part of the learning during this course will occur during group projects. You'll harden the skills you learned in class, learn new skills and learn how to work on real-world open-ended projects.

We'll set aside class time during group projects to work on them. It's essential that you attend class during these times. It's the only opportunity you will have access to me, the TAs, and your group members _at the same time_. We'll provide advice on scoping your projects, help you make good technical choices and help you troubleshoot complex issues.

## Course Policies

### Grading
Grades will be based on:
* Participation (10%)
* Homework Assignments (20%)
* Midterm Group Project (30%)
* Final Group Project (40%)

Final grades will be determined on the basis of the following rubric.  

Please note: to ensure fairness, all numbers are absolute, and will not be rounded up or down at any stage. Thus a B- will be inclusive of all scores of 80.000 through 83.999.  A = 94-100 A- = 90-93 B+ = 87-89 B = 84-86 B- = 80-83 C+ = 77-79 C = 74-76 C- = 70-73 D+ = 67-69 D = 64-66 D- = 60-63 F = 0-60.  

Grades will be _not_ be curved. Please do not ask me about extra credit or extra work to improve your grade. None will be given.

### Participation

Your participation grade will be based on the extent to which you attend class during project work weeks and participate in your groups' meetings and your attendance during the midterm and final presentations. Should you have exceptional circumstances where you cannot attend class during project work, you must make arrangements with your group and inform me of these arrangements.

### Homework Assignments

* There will be 8-12 homeworks assigned during the semester.
* Homework will not be assigned during project weeks but may be due during them.
* Due dates will be announced as homeworks is assigned. Homeworks will typically be due a week from when they are assigned.
* Late homework will _not_ be accepted.
* The _two_ lowest-scoring homeworks will be dropped to allow you some flexibility throughout the semester.
* Howeworks will be submitted in _private_ Github repositories by submitting the link to Canvas and inviting the TAs. Homework solutions may not be made public.

### Group Projects and Group Project Presentations

* Students will form groups of around five students. (Sizes are subject to change based on enrollment.)
* Students may opt to form different groups for the midterm and final projects.
* Projects will be developed and submitted in public GitHub repositories. You are encouraged to share your projects.
* Projects will be graded based on _both_ group and individual requirements. GitHub will allow us to see who makes which contributions.
* Midterm Projects will be presented in class. Each group will have 3 minutes to present a lightning talk and 2 minutes of Q & A. (Presentation times are subject to change based on enrollment.)
* Final Projects will be presented during the final exam time slot for the course. Each group will have 10 minutes to present their project and 5 minutes of Q & A. (Presentation times are subject to change based on enrollment.)
* You must attend every group's presentation on presentation days, not just your own group's.
* If you know in advance that you have a conflict with one of the presentation dates (e.g., due to travel or religious observance) or require accommodations, please see me as soon as possible to work out an alternative. 
* If you will be absent from a project presentation, you must notify me prior to the presentation at edwardkrueger@utexas.edu. Where advanced notification is not feasible, **the notification must be given by the end of the second day after the absence.** Non-excused absences will result in a zero for that portion of your grade.
