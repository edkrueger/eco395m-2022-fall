# Course Description and Requirements

## Overview
This is a master's level course on Python, databases and big data. Our goal in this course is to learn the fundamental programming and data skills for working with data using a standard, modern tech stack. This is a foundational but fast-paced course; as such, we will move very quickly. We'll prefer practical applications over theoretical explorations.

Though we'll be learning many tools in this course, we'll focus on the big picture. By the end of this course, you should have a conceptual understanding of the data ecosystem as well as the practical skills required to programmatically access, load and manipulate data.

What this course is not:
* This is *_not_* a course in computer science. We won't cover topics like designing and evaluating algorithms or the inner working of databases.
* This is *_not_* a course on machine learning or AI. We won't cover machine learning algorithms. However, the material in this course is complementary: collecting, manipulating and maintaining data is a prerequisite to applied ML/AI.
* This is *_not_* a course on statistics. We won't cover the _statistical_ analysis of data. However, you'll find the material complementary: once data is in the correct form, most statistical tests are available in open-source packages and extremely simple to apply.
* This is *_not_* a course on application development. However, we will incidentally cover many of the same fundamentals and serve as a strong foundation.

## Reading and References
All reading and references for this course are optional. If you can complete the homework and contribute to your group projects without them, feel free to. There are many resources, freely available and otherwise.

That said, the quality of resources, especially the freely available ones, varies tremendously. There is a tremendous amount of bad advice, bad practices and just plain wrong information about coding and data on the internet.

Here is a non-exhaustive list of resources that I recommend and will suggest readings from in class:
* _Unix for the Beginning Mage_ by Joe Topjian (Freely available online.)
* _git - the simple guide_ by Roger Dudler (Freely available here: https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)
* _Think Python : How to Think Like a Computer Scientist_ By Downey, Allen B. (Get the 2nd edition. The 1st edition is written for Python 2, which is rather unlike Python 3)
* _Pandas 1. x Cookbook : Practical Recipes for Scientific Computing, Time Series Analysis, and Exploratory Data Analysis Using Python_ by Harrison, Matt and Petrou, Theodore (I'll be using the 2nd edition to suggest reading. The 1st edition uses an older version of Pandas, but should be mostly applicable.)
* _Practical SQL: A Beginner's Guide to Storytelling with Data_ by DeBarros, Anthony (I will use the 1st edition to suggest reading. However, a 2nd edition is coming out at the end of January. If you'd like to wait for its release, feel free to. We won't start SQL until after the midterm project.)

Other resources that I recommend:
* _Effective Pandas_ by Matt Harrison (An excellent read published after I selected textbooks for this course.)
* The Python Documentation: https://docs.python.org/3.7/
* The Pandas Documentation: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/
* The Postgres Documentation: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/
* The BigQuery Documentation: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery

## Software

We will use a lot of free, open-source software in this course, including but not limited to Python, Git and Postgres. I'll indicate when you need to install new software in class and sometimes make specific recommendations. If needed, the TAs will assist during TA office hours.

In addition, we'll use GitHub. The free plan will be sufficient for this course.

Finally, we will use Google Cloud Platform (GCP). GCP charges by use of services but offers a $300 credit to new accounts. This _should_ be sufficient for this course. Costs _may_, in some circumstances, exceed the credit amount. We'll provide guidance in keeping costs under control in class. _Please wait to redeem the credit until we instruct you to._

## Prerequisites

There are no formal prerequisites for this course. However, success in this course requires computer literacy, including the ability to install, use and troubleshoot software.

We will start from the beginning with Python. However, some slight exposure to programming is recommended to understand what you are signing up for. Programming is quite different from other skills you have acquired through your academic career.

## How to Succeed in This Course

### Durring Lectures
Lectures will be fast-paced, and you must pay attention in class. It can be tempting to replicate every step I take and write the same code I write _while in the lecture_. I don't recommend this as you'll likely fall behind and miss out on new material. So it may be wise to consider not opening your computer at all during class.

### Outside of Class
If you'd like to go back and try to replicate the work I do in class, you will have a recording of the lectures. Your homework and group projects will provide you with an opportunity to do it yourself.

After getting the big picture from lectures, the best way to learn to program is to do it. Attending lectures and completing the readings won't be sufficient. In fact, you should consider attempting the HWs first and consulting the readings if you need assistance.

Please attend office hours.

### During Group Projects

A large part of the learning during this course will occur during group projects. You'll harden the skills you learned in class, learn new skills and learn how to work on real-world open-ended projects.

We'll set aside class time during group projects to work on them. It's essential that you attend class during these times. It's the only opportunity you will have access to me, the TAs, and your group members _at the same time_. We'll provide advice on scoping your projects, help you make good technical choices and help you troubleshoot complex issues.

# University Disclosures and Policies

## Statement on Academic Integrity and Conduct
The University of Texas Honor Code states:  

> The core values of The University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom, leadership, individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of the university is expected to uphold these values through integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect toward peers and community.

Each student in this course is expected to abide by the UT Honor Code and uphold academic integrity.  

*What this means for this course*:  
You are encouraged to study together and to discuss information and concepts covered in lecture and the recitation sections with other students.
You can work together on homework assignments.
However, this cooperation should never involve one student having possession of or copying directly from another student’s work.
Should such copying occur, both students involved will receive zeros for the assignment.
For group projects, the Honor Code means that the work you represent as your contributions must be your own.
_Git and GitHub will allow us to see your individual contributions to group projects._

## Sharing of Course Materials is Prohibited
No materials used in this class, including, but not limited to, lecture hand-outs, assessments (homework assignments), in-class materials, and review sheets, may be shared online or with anyone outside of the class - or in future classes - unless you have my explicit, written permission. Unauthorized sharing of materials promotes cheating. It is a violation of the University’s Student Honor Code and an act of academic dishonesty. I am well aware of the sites used for sharing materials, and any materials found online that are associated with you, or any suspected unauthorized sharing of materials, will be reported to Student Conduct and Academic Integrity in the Office of the Dean of Students. These reports can result in sanctions, including failure in the course.

## Class Recordings:
Class recordings are reserved only for students in this class for educational purposes and are protected under FERPA. The recordings should not be shared outside the class in any form. Violation of this restriction by a student could lead to Student Misconduct proceedings.
