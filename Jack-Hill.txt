Hello,

My name is Jack Hill and thorough a sick twisted of fate, I found myself deep in the boiling water that is graduate school in Austin (like, literally have you been here in the summer?) I was pulled into economics after a high school summer economics summer camp and further still by the AP Economics curriculum. I attempted to code in my AP Comp SCI class, but the 2 on the AP exam clearly showed me that my talents lied else where. But the roaming train of big data was running hot, and I thought that a economic master's program was a prefect way to avoid adult responsibility and squeeze in two more years of the "college experience" while maintaining a modicum of respect for my professional career. 

Outside of school, I love photography and soccer. I specialize in portrait and photojournalism, and on the soccer field, I am a trash talking specialist. Beyond my two loves, I also enjoy hiking, road-tripping, rock climbing, boxing, yoga, creative writing and skateboarding. My favorite chill activity is to camp out in my hammock and vibe to some good music. These activities are mostly solitary ub nature BUTTTT when my social battery is charged, my favorite thing to do is to meet new people and hear about their life stories. I have a super power, in which I am almost never shy meeting to strangers and I warm up to people very quickly.  So I have heard a far share of very interesting life stories and debated topics as far and wide as the seven seas.
