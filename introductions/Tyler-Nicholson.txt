Hi, my name is Tyler Nicholson. I'm interested in game theory, IO, and circles (Go Archimedes!). My favorite joke that I like to tell my dad (who is a programmer) and his buddies who are also programmers is the following: A clown, a mime, and a programmer walk into a bar. Everyone laughs at the programmer.
