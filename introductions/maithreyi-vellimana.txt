Hi! I am Maithreyi Vellimana. I am graduate student at Cockrell School of Engineering. I am in the transportation engineering program.
I have been interested in data analytics and some sort of programming for a while. I am hoping to get into that industry in some capacity and want
to develop the required skill sets. I have heard Python and SQL are used extensively in the industry and I am hoping to get more fluent using these programs.
Before joining UT, I used to work as a traffic engineer at WSP. I am originally from India and I have lived in many countries in the middle east 
while growing up. Excited for this course!
