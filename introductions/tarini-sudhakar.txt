Hi, I am Tarini. My name means someone who gets you across the river. I am not sure how closely names are meant to reflect personalities, but I did once jump into one of the coldest rivers in north India after rafting (and then fell sick for a week). I am from New Delhi, India, but grew up all over the country.

During my undergraduate, I explored how incentives shape societies using my learnings from law, history, and economics. I worked in a public policy think tank for nearly four years as a researcher, focusing on regulatory challenges in education, agriculture, and environment in India.

As an M.A. Economics student at UT Austin, I am interested in looking at the intersection of law, economics, and data science. I hope to build and exercise these skills as part of this course.
