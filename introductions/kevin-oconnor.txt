Hello, my name is Kevin O'Connor
I love data science, economics, and cryptocurrencies in no particular order.
 This semester I am learning how to code in python and solidity.
 I have a few possible project ideas, such as developing a capital asset pricing model for commercial real estate in Nueces county for a PE group I am connected to.
This could be acheived by crawling webpages such as redfin, and running a series of regressions.
I look forward to working with you all, and I am very excited for this class.
