Hello! My name is Austin Longoria and I'm from Houston, TX. I am skepitcal of the food industry as well
 as some fields within the modern medicine. As such, I may want to research economic incentives within
 these industries. In addition,I personally find the market's pricing mechanism to be one of the most 
 fascinating and important aspects of economics. I'm thinking about getting a PhD, but I'm taking this
 class to make sure I have the skills to succeed in the private sector. I also have a deep interest in
 statistics and what data itself can tell us about the world. I don't have a lot of experience 
 managing large raw data sets, so I am excited to learn more about it!
