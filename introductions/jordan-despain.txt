Hello, my name is Jordan Despain. I am 29 years old and have lived in Texas my whole life.
I have really enjoyed studying economics as an undergrad and now as a student in this masters program.
Studying economics also helped me realize I love programming and working with data, so I am grateful for that.
After I am done with school, I hope I end up in a career where I am doing these things, such as a data scientist.
I am looking forward to meeting everyone in this class.
