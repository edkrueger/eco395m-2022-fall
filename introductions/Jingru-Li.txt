I'm Jingru Li
My major is applied economics in CUHKSZ, my undergraduate school.
I hope to study data science in the future. For my career goal is to being a researcher in Internet companies.
My interest and ambition is to develop my own indie game. 
However, it's quite difficult to achieve this with little programming knowledge. 
That's why I take this course. (I also study game developing software like Unity on my own but just get started)
