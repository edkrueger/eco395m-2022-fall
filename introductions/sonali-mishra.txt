Hi, I am Sonali and I am from India. I have worked at the India Parliament (Policy) and at Amazon (data). The intersection of these two fields drewe me to economics i.e to be able to answer policy questions and understand its causation. Over the last 5 years I have realised the power of refining data to get theright result. Something that I have been interested in for quite sometime is the interaction of machine learning techniques with econometrics. Somethings I looking forward to from this class is Web Scrapping models.
